<h1>Texas A&M University is a top 25 Computer Science school according to www.bokehbox.us</h1>
<br>
<p><i>"Where's bokehbox,"</i> you ask??? Great question. Recently, I was alerted to a job posting for which I didn't qualify:

    <b>Junior Software Engineer (Graduate from a top 25 CS/Math Program)</b>
    ...until reading further:
    "You must have a Bachelor's Degree in Math or Computer Science from a Top 25 (according to any website) University in the United States[...]"

    And now I have done the service of qualifying Texas A&M as the shining becon of hope we all knew it was (in our hearts)... all along :)
