## About

Simple photo portfolio to learn React.js, design and AWS stuff. Originally hacked together for an assignment in a COMM elective, but I actually like this site as a basic platform for my webpage.

This is getting refactored into the landing page of my website, and photolio will likely end up as a seperate project linked to from that page. I'll have blogs and other stuff. The usual.

Currently hosted [here](https://www.bokehbox.us)


### Install/run:

`yarn`

`yarn start`

### Deployment:

`yarn build`

`yarn deploy`

### But wait, there's more!

Huge, huge, huge shoutout to Raj Shekhar who made [this](https://github.com/rajshekhar26/cleanfolio) portfolio templates which I would highly recommend playing around with if you want to learn the React.js basics.
